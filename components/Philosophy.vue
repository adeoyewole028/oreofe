          I believe that Product management is more than building and managing
          productsâ€”it is about understanding what users needs, aligning with the
          business goals and working with a supportive team. My product approach
          combines clear communication with empathy, placing the user at the
          heart of every decision. This is just the beginning of my product
          management journey. I'm excited to keep learning, collaborating, and
          building products that make a positive impact
