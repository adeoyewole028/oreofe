        <p class="text-balance">
          I believe that Product management is more than building and managing
          products — it is about understanding what users needs, aligning with
          the business goals and working with a supportive team.
        </p>
        <p class="text-balance">
          My product approach combines clear communication with empathy, placing
          the user at the heart of every decision. This is just the beginning of
          my product management journey.
        </p>
        <p class="text-balance">
          I'm excited to keep learning, collaborating, and building products
          that make a positive impact.
